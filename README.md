CS 130 class project 

Goal is to create an online tool to help machine learning beginners understand their CNN models.

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that can automatically generate visual representations of layers in a model and illustrate how layers are connected.

Our website will allow users to upload their trained models and view both interactable graphs representing model structure and learned filters or layers inside the "black box". Users would also be able to adjust or selectively include or exclude different filters. This would help improve speed and effectiveness on final model for the user, since users can decide if they should disregard parameters that are less influential in the classification of images.
